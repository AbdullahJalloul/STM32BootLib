# STBootLib
C# library for communicating with STM32 USART (UART) On-Chip Bootloaders, comes with simple Updater application, just to show the potential :) 

Implements basic functionality (no write/read protection). All done in async/await manner. This is my response to ST's crappy Flash Loader Demonstrator, that tends to crash my PC due to some shady Serial Port access routines.

Here's a post on my blog about this software: http://mightydevices.com/?p=519
